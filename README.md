# practice_c
These are just my collection of example c scripts while learning c.

I use c mainly for string manipulations: read a file line by line and process each line. I add [klib](https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib) here with some modifications.

Now I have examples for using dynamic arrays, hashes, and kstring (easy split).
